# **CDKTF Errors and Solutions**

This documentation outlines common errors encountered while using the **Cloud Development Kit for Terraform (CDKTF)**, particularly when working with AWS providers, TypeScript, and related libraries. Each section describes the error, its possible cause, and detailed solutions.

---

## **1. Dependency Conflicts (npm ERESOLVE Error)**

### **Error Message:**
```plaintext
npm error ERESOLVE unable to resolve dependency tree
```

### **Description:**
This error occurs when there are conflicting dependencies in the `package.json` file. Incompatible versions between packages, like `@cdktf/provider-aws` and `cdktf`, can cause this issue.

### **Possible Causes:**
- Different packages request conflicting versions of a peer dependency.
- The version ranges of dependencies cannot be satisfied simultaneously.

### **Solution:**
- **Check and Update Dependency Versions:**
  Ensure that the dependencies in your `package.json` are compatible. The `cdktf` version required by `@cdktf/provider-aws` must match the installed version.

- **Use Legacy Peer Dependencies:**
  To bypass peer dependency resolution, you can run the following command:
  ```bash
  npm install --legacy-peer-deps
  ```
  This allows npm to install dependencies even if peer dependencies don’t exactly match.

- **Force Installation (last resort):**
  If conflicts persist, force the installation:
  ```bash
  npm install --force
  ```
  Note: Forcing installation may introduce broken or unstable versions.

### **Example Resolution:**
```bash
npm install --save-exact @cdktf/provider-aws@5.0.52 cdktf@0.20.9 constructs@10.4.2 typescript@5.6.3 ts-node@10.9.2 --legacy-peer-deps
```

## **2. TypeScript Compilation Errors**

### **Error Message:**
```plaintext
error TS2724: '"@cdktf/provider-aws"' has no exported member named 'AwsProvider'.
error TS2305: Module '"@cdktf/provider-aws/lib/vpc"' has no exported member 'SecurityGroup'.
```

### **Description:**
This error occurs when TypeScript cannot find the specific classes or modules in your imports. This may happen if the imports are incorrect or if there is an issue with the installed package versions.

### **Possible Causes:**
- Incorrect or outdated imports.
- Missing or improperly installed packages.
- Conflicting versions of CDKTF or AWS providers.

### **Solution:**
- **Verify Imports:**
  Ensure that you are importing the correct classes and modules. For example:
  ```typescript
  import { AwsProvider } from "@cdktf/provider-aws";
  import { SecurityGroup, SecurityGroupRule } from "@cdktf/provider-aws/lib/vpc";
  ```

- **Ensure Package Installation:**
  If a required package is missing, install it:
  ```bash
  npm install @cdktf/provider-aws
  ```

- **Correct Package Version Mismatches:**
  Ensure that the version of `@cdktf/provider-aws` you are using is compatible with the installed `cdktf` version.

## **3. Backend Configuration Change**

### **Error Message:**
```plaintext
Error: Backend configuration changed
```

### **Description:**
This error occurs when Terraform detects a change in backend configuration (where the Terraform state is stored). Terraform requires either a state migration or a backend reconfiguration.

### **Possible Causes:**
- Changes to the `backend` block in your `cdktf` configuration.
- The need to switch backends or move the state file.

### **Solution:**
- **Automatic Migration:**
  To attempt an automatic migration of the Terraform state, run:
  ```bash
  cdktf init -migrate-state
  ```

- **Backend Reconfiguration:**
  If you don’t want to modify the state, you can reconfigure the backend:
  ```bash
  cdktf init -reconfigure
  ```

## **4. Initialization in a Non-Empty Directory**

### **Error Message:**
```plaintext
ERROR: Cannot initialize a project in a non-empty directory
```

### **Description:**
This error occurs when trying to initialize a new CDKTF project in a directory that already contains files. CDKTF requires an empty directory for initialization to prevent file conflicts.

### **Possible Causes:**
- You are trying to initialize a project in a directory with existing files or folders.

### **Solution:**
- **Use an Empty Directory:**
  Create a new directory and navigate into it before running the `cdktf init` command.
  ```bash
  mkdir new-project-directory
  cd new-project-directory
  cdktf init
  ```

---

## **5. Unknown Arguments in Command**

### **Error Message:**
```plaintext
Unknown arguments: m, i, g, r, a, t, e
```

### **Description:**
This error happens when CDKTF doesn’t recognize the command-line arguments passed. This can occur due to incorrect syntax or deprecated commands.

### **Possible Causes:**
- Typos or incorrect command syntax.
- Unsupported or deprecated commands in the current version of CDKTF.

### **Solution:**
- **Check Command Syntax:**
  Ensure that the commands and options you are using are correct. For example:
  - Correct command for migrating state:
    ```bash
    cdktf init -migrate-state
    ```
  - Correct command for backend reconfiguration:
    ```bash
    cdktf init -reconfigure
    ```

- **Verify CDKTF Version:**
  Ensure you are using a version of CDKTF that supports the command you are trying to run.

## **6. Not Found Errors (npm 404)**

### **Error Message:**
```plaintext
npm error 404 Not Found - GET https://registry.npmjs.org/contructs - Not found
```

### **Description:**
This error indicates that npm cannot find the package you are trying to install. This is commonly due to a typo in the package name.

### **Possible Causes:**
- Typo in the package name.
- The package is not available on the npm registry.

### **Solution:**
- **Verify Package Name:**
  Double-check the spelling of the package name in the `npm install` command. For example, the correct package name is `constructs` and not `contructs`.

- **Install Missing Package:**
  If the package is missing, install it using:
  ```bash
  npm install constructs
  ```

## **7. Terraform Init Failed with Exit Code 1**

### **Error Message:**
```plaintext
terraform init failed with exit code 1
```

### **Description:**
This error occurs when Terraform initialization fails. It often provides little detail about the specific cause of the issue, but is generally due to misconfiguration in the Terraform project.

### **Possible Causes:**
- Issues with the backend configuration.
- Incorrect or missing provider configurations.

### **Solution:**
- **Check the Backend Configuration:**
  Review the `backend` block in your `main.ts` file or in any related Terraform configurations.

- **Run CDKTF Init:**
  Ensure that the environment is initialized properly before deployment:
  ```bash
  cdktf init
  ```

- **Reconfigure Backend:**
  If the backend configuration changed, reinitialize the backend:
  ```bash
  cdktf init -reconfigure
  ```

## **8. npm Version Conflicts (ETARGET Error)**

### **Error Message:**
```plaintext
npm error code ETARGET
npm error notarget No matching version found for typescript@5.0.0.
```

### **Description:**
This error occurs when npm cannot find a version of a package that matches the specified version in `package.json`. In this case, the version `5.0.0` of TypeScript does not exist, or it may not be available in the npm registry.

### **Solution:**
- **Check Available Versions:**
  Visit the [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/) and check for available versions of the package. For TypeScript, use a version that exists, such as `5.6.3`.
  
- **Correct Version Number:**
  Update your `package.json` to use a valid version of the package:
  ```json
  "typescript": "^5.6.3"
  ```

- **Install Specific Version:**
  Install the correct version with the command:
  ```bash
  npm install typescript@5.6.3
  ```
